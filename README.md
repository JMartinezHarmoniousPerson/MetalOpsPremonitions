# Metal Ops: Premonitions
 Metal Ops: Premonitions is a weapons mod that emulates a mixture of classic and modern style game play. Although mostly having the Doom formula, it also has a mix of modern FPS game play formula. The weapons have a more updated or futuristic look, different weapons, and such. You also have a kick attack (default bind Q) that you can do at any time, even while reloading or shooting. You also have Molotov cocktails and frag grenades(default bind G) in possession, but currently only able to be picked up with backpacks. You can switch throwable types too (default bind B). This is my first mod, so if you have any criticisms or suggestions, feel free to ask below. Just a note since that this is the first release, the whole mod is subjected to change in the future, such as adding new features, weapons, better effects, better art and such. Brutal Doom Monsters Only compatibility is also in place, just load Metal Ops after Brutal Doom Monsters Only. I would like to thank the mods Brutal Doom, Project Brutality, Insanity's Requiem, Complex Doom and Trailblazer for being an inspiration for the creation of Metal Ops: Premonitions.

## How to Install
- Use GZDoom 4.6 or higher. I recommend 4.8.2 or 4.11 dev builds. For Android, use Delta Touch.
This mod will NOT work on LZDoom.
- Using a frontend like ZDL, Doomrunner or SSGL is recommended.
- If you're using monster mods, I recommend loading Metal Ops after the monster mods so there are no issues.

## Bug reporting and feedback
If you have a bug to report, please post on the Issues tab or message me on ModDB.

Any feedback or suggestions will be appreciated.
IF YOUR FEEDBACK IS BASED ON THE MOTION BLUR USED ON SOME SPRITES, IT IS AN ARTISTIC CHOICE I MADE.
